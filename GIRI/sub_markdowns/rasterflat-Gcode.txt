All the rasterflat G-codes run the wheel over some grinding area defined by:
L TEACH, R TEACH (Z dimensions), and the X value you supply in line 15 of the program (G91G01X#.#F###). 
You should also change the number of loops (line 2: M98P1000L###) to suit your needs. 
Running this script will grind away L * -0.001 inches of rock.

never gets run, so don't worry about it.
