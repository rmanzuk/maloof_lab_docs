## First, we removed the camera and its wiring. 
1. Remove camera curtain, which is velcro-ed on top around camera housing. 
2. Remove ethernet, which is a blue cord wired though the top of the camera housing. 
3. Remove the camera back: Push button on RH side, pull up to get the back out. Black square plate goes on the top of the non-viewer side. Remove batteries and put them into the appropriate slit in the foam in the large black case. We packed this into the black zippered case and into the large black box, inside the foam. The 72 mm lens, back, and batteries are all inside the white foam piece.
4. Loosen the yellow levers on the front (facing you) of the grinder to lower the ringlight. The use Allen keys (red and yellow cases) to remove the camera itself. It was set in the track, rotated so that the notches matched. The two screws are on the LH, RH sides of where the camera sits. Pictures 3908 and 9000 on PMH phone.
5. We packaged the IQ4, 72mm lens, 120 mm lens, and charger in the black box thus labeled. 

## Next, we removed the light bricks and ring light.
1. Lights 7, 8 (7 is the one closest to you when facing grinder) are the yellow cords that we unscrewed from these bricks. Pictures ...1455 and ...8445 on PMH phone. 
2. Use Allen key to remove the UV bricks by the silver arms. We taped the 2 screws along the top rim into place.
3. Took wood glass filter out (pop out 3d printed side guard, slide out) and cleaned with lens wipe. Both filters are in the same box. 
4. Unscrew ring light cords, which are labeled as L, R when you are facing grinder. Picture ..1592 on PMH phone. At this point, all cords to camera and lights are disconnected.
5. Use Allen key to unscrew ring light's connector on the right (when facing grinder). There are 3 screws; we did the closest one first. Hold up the ringlight while unscrewing. Picture ...3612 on PMH phone.

We left the rest of the camera apparatus on the grinder. 

## We then removed the roller and other connected devices.
1. On the grinder console, Func. 1 and OUT1 to move roller up and down. IMG_8892 on ACM phone. 
2. When it is up, unscrew rightmost screw on yellow 3d printed piece using Allen key, then slide off blue piece laying on top of the rim. 
3. The oil coolant unit (autolubricator) is the b/w box on the RH side of grinder. Fill it with oil from the red oil container near the coolant box. Picture 2577 on PMH phone.

2. Disconnected the air--took off its yellow cord, which is in the back right when facing PLC front. 
3. Turn off grinder by flipping switch on front of grinder. 
4. Unplug black cord, which is power for the PLC.
5. Unplug gray/white PLC data to computer cord.
