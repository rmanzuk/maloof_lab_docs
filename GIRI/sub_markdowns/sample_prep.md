## Preparing a sample for serial grinding and imaging

1) This recipe assumes that your sample is well lithified or epoxy-injected such that it will withstand the grinding and imaging process without falling apart. For vacuum injection of epoxy into samples, contact [Wagner petrographic](http://wagnerpetrographic.com). We have had some luck mounting loose grains like ooids ourselves by 3D printing one of the boxes below and successively layering the grains in this [table top epoxy resin](https://masepoxies.com/product/table-top-epoxy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsp6pBhCfARIsAD3GZuZvY6Mlc-rvrGY6VEFGhych-UP304RyY_hcOdk5y4VX3xdpKuVCHMcaAr-fEALw_wcB)

2) Saw your sample down to size such the horizontal dimensions are roughly the size of the imaging field of view you plan to use. No need to grind superfluous rock, but a little extra is okay. Generally, rectangular prism shapes are easiest to work with, and certainly try to ensure that the top and bottom surface are close to parallel. If working with an oriented sample, I find it easiest to work with having the top surface be the oriented surface such that you know the orientation of your imaging plane and can do all later rotations with respect to that (just be sure the orientation mark is captured in one of the first images for record keeping).

3) With your sawed sample, you’re ready to mount it to a steel plate. We use 1/4” low-carbon steel sheets from McMaster-Carr. The most common dimensions we use are [3x3”](https://www.mcmaster.com/1388K102/), [3x6”](https://www.mcmaster.com/1388K106/), and [4x4”](https://www.mcmaster.com/1388K104/). Just pick a size such that your whole sample fits without much or any overhang. Sand the top surface of the steel plate and the bottom surface of your sample with coarse (~60 grit) sand paper so there is a rough surface for the epoxy to grab onto.

4) Rinse the sanded surfaces with water to remove grit, and blow dry with an air hose.

5) Put on gloves and extrude enough [2 ton epoxy](https://www.mcmaster.com/66215A24/) into a mixing cup to coat the whole bottom surface of your sample. 3-4 pulls of the trigger tends to be plenty for most samples. 

6) Mix the epoxy with a popsicle stick for at least 2 minutes.

7) Use the popsicle stick to apply a coat to the bottom surface of the sample and place the sample on the steel plate. I tend to then apply any extra epoxy to the corner where the sample meets the plate as extra reinforcement. 

8) Allow the epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours. (You can remove the gloves at this point).

9) Before placing the sample on the machine, de-bur and smooth the bottom surface of the steel plate by applying [sharpening stone oil](https://www.amazon.com/Norton-Abrasives-07660787940-Sharpening-Stone/dp/B000I1AVDW/ref=asc_df_B000I1AVDW/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198090983914&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2480446956776683294&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003941&hvtargid=pla-384768754761&psc=1) to the surface and polishing it with the coarse (red) sharpening stone in a figure 8 pattern. It may be tough to move the stone at first, but it should ease up as the plate gets de-burred. Once the stone glides fairly easily over the plate surface, you can switch to the fine (gray) sharpening stone to finish up with 10 or so more passes.
