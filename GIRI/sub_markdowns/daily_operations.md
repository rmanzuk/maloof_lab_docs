## Daily operations to grind and image a sample
1) Stick a ruler in the coolant tank to measure the depth. If there is less than 6” depth, the level is a little low and more should be added (see: Mixing and adding coolant).

2) If the wheel has not run in a few hours, allow it to run for 10 minutes or so to rebalance. You can continue to prep the run while the wheel is warming up. **Note: Glasses on while wheel is running**

3) Turn on the coolant and use a plastic pipette to draw some up from the spout and make a refractometry reading. It should read just above 2. In this case, as long as there aren’t long-term increases in refractometry, it’s okay.

   *Steps 4-6 do not need to be done daily. Maybe once a month*

4) Use a pH strip to check pH. Should be 9-10, higher is better.

5) Use a strip to check hardness. Should be around 250.

6) Use a strip to check alkalinity. Should be greater than 240.

7) Use a wet paper towel to wipe off the orange roller.

8) Check the black back curtain to make sure it won’t get pushed down by the roller during the run. Reposition if needed.

9) On the onboard computer, check the number of loops programmed in the G code (third line “M98P1000L___” with number of loops coming after L). If needed, change the number of loops to fit what you need for this run. No more than ~250 per run please.

10) On the onboard computer, push the big green ‘Start’ button.

11) Write measurements taken of coolant into the notebook log.

12) Check the amount of space on the hard drive to ensure there is enough room for the images to be taken during this set of grinds. 

13) Type the command barebones_serial into Matlab and follow the prompts to get the grind started.
   
### Mixing and adding Coolant

1) Depending on desired volume of coolant, pour DI into bucket. Usually 5 or 10 L

2) Add coolant at 2.5% concentration (always put DI in bucket and add coolant to it)

3) Stir

4) Pour into machine through the filter paper.
