## Mitsui CNC surface grinder

The basis for GIRI is a Mitsui MSF-818PC-NC CNC surface grinder.

#### Grinding wheel

For grinding samples, we use diamond abrasive surface grinding wheels from Norton. We use 6" diameter, 1/2" thick, 1-1/4" hole wheels. At the moment, we use a [320 grit wheel](https://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/90923806) for plunge grinding, which may even be too fine for this application and could be switched to a 220 or coarser grit in the future. To limit the appearance of scratch marks in 3D automated grinding and imaging work, we use a 400 grit wheel. The wheel was never listed on the MSC website, so contact Norton or MSC directly for a replacement. The part description is: 6X1/2X1-1/4 1A1 GRIND WHL ASD400-R75-B99-1/4QIA 

For balancing and truing the wheel, see the [Wheel balancing and truing](wheel_balancing_truing.md) section.

If there are ever any issues with surface quality when grinding, Norton tends to be very helpful in diagnosing the issue and sometimes recommending a different wheel if you contact them directly. Our most recent area rep was Ryan Chung. Ken from Millennium Machinery also recommended that we could reach out to Chuck Stormes at [South Bay Supply](http://www.southbayllc.com/aboutus/) for further adviece and even custom wheels.

#### Coolant

We try to keep coolant in the tank at > 6" depth at all times. When coolant is low, mix [Monroe AstroGRIND A](https://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/00267781) to 2.5% concentration with deionized water and pour into the tank through the filter paper. If you're doing a lot of grinding, the coolant should be completely replaced ~1 time per year. There is no great way to clean out the tank when replacing coolant, so just try to get as much out as you can with the crank pump, and scrape the rest out with something like a piece of cardboard. If you detach the pump wires from the tank, you can take it outside and try to open its valves to flush sediment out into the storm drain. Once the tank is empty and clean, refill with 2.5% coolant.

Every 6 months or so, it's a good idea to check the chemistry of the coolant, just in case anything wild is happening. We use [pH Test Strips](https://www.mcmaster.com/11235T62/), [Hardness Test Strips](https://www.mcmaster.com/11235T41/), and [Alkalinity Test Strips](https://www.mcmaster.com/11235T51/), and aim for readings around:
- pH: 10
- Hardness: 120 ppm
- Alkalinity: 240 ppm (Reading usually looks to be greater than 240, but that's the max listed on the container)

#### Autolubricator

Don't need to know much about the autolubricator (large wheeled module attached to the grinder through a few hoses). For maintenance, check the air filter on the front for dust every 6 months or so. If dusty, rinse clean in the sink. Check its oil levels, which should only have to be topped up to the yellow line 1x per year or so with [Red Mobil #6 Chiller Oil](https://www.grainger.com/product/4ZF38?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:4P7A1P:20501231&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgJyyBhCGARIsAK8LVLPaWAsWm7SLFO9yRmcPppd6mvyLQ0vntz83gBcTBF1fW71n4ka5-i8aAgleEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
