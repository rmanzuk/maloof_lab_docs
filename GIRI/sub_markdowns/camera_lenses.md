## Camera

#### RCAM: 

The basis of our camera setup is a Digital Transitions RCAM, which is a solution for high-fidelity reprographic photography. This setup is common for libraries documenting/digitizing rare and important print works. The RCAM is basically a precision-machined metal tube that allows us to attach a medium-format digital camera back to one side, and a lenses (via lens boards and extension tubes) to the other side. 
#### Phase One IQ4 digital back: 
We upgraded to the Phase One IQ4 150 megapixel achromatic back in 2021. Prior to this sensor, we were using a Phase One IQ180 80 megapixel RGB back. This sensor gives the opportunity for high-resolution (~3.4um pixels) imaging of any lightwave in the backâ€™s sensitivity range of ~400-1000nm. Note that the back itself has a digital shutter, so it should be complemented with lenses that have no shutter or have the shutter programmed to be constantly open.

#### Wire grid polarizer:
Off-the-shelf, circular polarizers for photography only are effective in visible light. For broadband polarizing capability, we use a wire grid polarizer. We worked with a company Moxtek to create a custom solution
